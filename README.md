in terminal
```
git clone git@github.com:jrose111284/thermostat_business_logic.git
open SpecRunner.html
```

I decided to redo this project just for a reminder on how to do jasmine tests.
This thermostat function can turn temperature up and down 10 to 20 degress with power saving mode on.
When power saving mode is off, it can go up to 32 degress.
It can also reset back to 20 degress with the reset function.
